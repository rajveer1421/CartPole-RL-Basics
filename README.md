# CartPole-v1 Reinforcement Learning 🏋️‍♂️🤖

I tried Reinforcement Learning for the **first time**!  
I was always amazed by how giant robots can be trained through simulations using reinforcement learning.  
I am grateful to try this for the first time in my life with the **CartPole-v1** environment from OpenAI Gym.  

In this project, I trained an agent to balance a pole on a moving cart by applying a fixed amount of force either to the **left** or **right** side.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **OpenAI Gym** environment: `CartPole-v1`  
- **Pygame** for visualization  

---

## 🎯 Goal
The agent learns to keep the pole balanced for as long as possible without falling.

---

## 📌 Future Work
- Improve training with better algorithms (e.g., DQN, Policy Gradients)  
- Save and load trained models  
- Compare results with different hyperparameters

## 🙌 Acknowledgements
Thanks to **OpenAI Gym** for providing such an amazing environment to learn reinforcement learning.
